This Spigot/PaperMC plugin enables players and entities to ride Minecarts seamlessly through Nether Portals.

It works by briefly dismounting the passenger (player or entity) of an occupied minecart before it hits a portal block, allowing the empty minecart to enter the portal according to native mechanics.  
After the minecart appeared in the other world, the previous passenger gets immediately teleported and remounted again, enabling a smooth and fast ride through portals.
